    "ImageNet is a massive dataset with over 1 million labeled images in 1000 categories. It's used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers. I'm not going to get into the details of convolutional networks here, but if you want to learn more about them, please [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU).\n",

    "Once trained, these models work astonishingly well as feature detectors for images they weren't trained on. Using a pre-trained network on images not in the training set is called transfer learning.

You can move them back from the GPU with `model.to('cpu')` which you'll commonly do when you need to operate on the network output outside of PyTorch.
